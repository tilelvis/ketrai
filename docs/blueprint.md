# **App Name**: ChainFlow AI

## Core Features:

- Proactive ETA Calculation: Calculates and updates ETAs by integrating real-time traffic, weather data, and planned routes via mapping APIs; uses a tool to analyze and predict potential delays.
- Smart Dispatch Recommendation: Analyzes multiple routes considering risk factors such as theft hotspots, accidents, and local events to recommend the safest and most efficient route. It outputs a risk index score for each route, and recommends the optimal route based on a variety of parameters and data analysis.
- Automated Insurance Claim Draft: Generates draft insurance claims by compiling package tracking history, damage evidence (photos), and product details using the claims tool to populate a pre-filled claim to the claims management API for review.
- Cross-Carrier Risk Visibility: Aggregates tracking data from multiple courier services to identify at-risk shipments by cross-checking against weather, strikes, and other disruption data sources and sends alerts to the Firebase dashboard using a summary report, also highlights risks from previous events
- Real-time Risk Monitoring Dashboard: Displays summarized supply chain risks, affected tracking numbers, and critical alerts on a Firebase dashboard. The data is updated from various carriers
- Customer SMS Notifications: Sends customer-friendly SMS updates with the updated ETA based on the most recent delivery and risk events.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL-inspired teal (#329DA6) for trust and efficiency.
- Background color: Light-teal (#E0F4F7) with low saturation, supporting clarity.
- Accent color: Indigo (#4B0082) a bold contrast, used sparingly for critical alerts and calls to action. (#3B5998)
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clear, simple icons representing each risk type (e.g., weather, strike) and carrier, with a modern, flat design style.
- Prioritize a clean, data-driven layout for the dashboard, using cards to organize information and a clear hierarchy for alerts.
- Subtle animations (e.g., fading in new data, highlighting critical alerts) to draw attention to important updates without being distracting.
